Progress

	Currently TIM16 has been verified to function
	Next experimentation will be with the DMA transfer.

	We will start with a fixed transfer that we properly "turn off" at the end of it.		(Done)
	(The solution will be to pad the transfer with an ending)

	Then we will do transfers that will be encoded from another buffer.
	We can test this by just having a buffer of PWM values that we supply over a smaller DMA buffer for the output		(Done)
	utilizing half and complete transfers.


	Now what is left is the actual LED driver stuff
